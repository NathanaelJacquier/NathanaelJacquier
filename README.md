- 👋 Hi, I’m @NathanaelJacquier I am currently a 2nd year student at CentraleSupelec
- 👀 I'm passionate about Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, and how their synergy can be leveraged to drive meaningful impact
- 🌱 I have a solid expertise in machine learning algorithms, including both classical methods like decision trees, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors, as well as advanced techniques such as ensemble models (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forests) and deep learning architectures (e.g., CNNs for image processing and LSTMs for sequential data)
- 💞️ I'm currently looking for a gap-year internship (6 months starting from July 2025)
