👋 Hi, I’m @NathanaelJacquier
🔬 I’m currently pursuing a research internship in Natural Language Processing (NLP), focusing on the scalability of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, as part of my gap year at CentraleSupélec.
💡 I’m passionate about Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, and particularly how their synergy can be leveraged to drive meaningful impact.
📚 I have strong expertise in machine learning algorithms, ranging from classical methods (decision trees, SVMs, k-NN) to advanced techniques such as ensemble models (XGBoost, Random Forests) and deep learning architectures (CNNs for computer vision, LSTMs for sequential data).

🔎 I’m currently looking for a second research internship (6 months, starting January 2025).
